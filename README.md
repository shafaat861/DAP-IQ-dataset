# DAP-IQ-dataset
The DAP-IQ dataset consists of hand-drawn human figures collected and categorized based on psychological assessment scores into seven intelligence quotient (IQ) levels. These levels follow standard psychometric classification criteria used in non-verbal IQ assessment tasks.

This dataset is intended for machine learning tasks such as classification and deep learning-based intelligence prediction using visual features extracted from hand-drawn sketches.
| Class Label                   | Description                                                                                 | IQ Range\*    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **1. Superior**               | Individuals with very high cognitive functioning; demonstrate exceptional reasoning ability | 120–129       |
| **2. Very Superior**          | Top-tier cognitive performance, excellent abstract thinking and problem-solving             | 130 and above |
| **3. High Average**           | Above average intellectual ability; learns quickly and processes information efficiently    | 110–119       |
| **4. Average**                | Represents typical cognitive functioning in the general population                          | 90–109        |
| **5. Below Average**          | Slight difficulty in learning or problem-solving compared to peers                          | 80–89         |
| **6. Mildly Impaired**        | Demonstrates mild intellectual disability; limited academic performance                     | 70–79         |
| **7. Significantly Impaired** | Marked cognitive limitations; requires support for daily functioning and learning tasks     | Below 70      |
